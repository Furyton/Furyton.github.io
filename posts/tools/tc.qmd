![xbeta blog about TC](https://xbeta.info/studytc/tc001.htm){width=100% height="4in"}

A [famous introductory blog](https://xbeta.info/studytc/tc001.htm) to [Total Commander](https://www.ghisler.com/).

Total Commander is a powerful customizable file manager tool.
It has enormous features that are totally beyond one's imagination.

Here is a quick note while learning the operation of TC from the blog[^1].

[^1]: [xbeta blog](https://xbeta.info/studytc/tc001.htm)

## Config files

`.ini` config file is recommended to be put under the installation directory.

For better management.

Also set `UseIniInProgramDir=7`, ignore register file.

[xbeta's config](/www/xbeta_wincmd.ini) file for learning.

## location and selection

### directory hotlist

`Ctrl+d x`

- hotlist = most used directorys

- extremely fast to navigate

::: {.callout-tip}
- use subdirectory in hotlist

- tidy up the hotlist periodically, e.g., make a `Ctrl+d n` (now) sublist for most frequent dirs recently.
:::

### change disk

`Alt+F1` for left panel, `Alt+F2` for right panel

### common way of changing dir

- `Enter` or `Backspace`

- `Ctrl+\` to root dir

### quick search

my config:

`Configuration` -> `Quick Search`

- tick `Letters only`

- uncheck `Beginning (...)`

- check `Ending (...)`

### History

`Alt+↓`

### Sorting

Sort with multiple keys.

E.g.,

- First click `Ext`

- Then, click `Date`, `Name` while pressing `Ctrl`

### Filtering

Show only the desired files

`Show` -> `Custom...`

### Coloring

`Configuration` -> `Color` -> `Define colors by file type...`

- 2days as red

- exe as purple

- 7days as blue

### Selecting

Recommend to use the default NC mode (right single click to select)

- `Configuration` -> `Operation`

Long right press for right menu.

### multiple selection

- `Alt+'+'` (`'+'` in the numeric keypad of keyboard): also select files with the same extension (you have already been selecting a file)

- `*` (also in the numeric keypad): reverse selection

- `+` and `-`: also select or unselect some files (pops up a window for you to choose)

- `Insert` for a single selection, function like right single click and then `↓`.

<!-- - `/` (also in the numeric keypad): unselect all files. -->

### Branch View

`Ctrl+b`: show all files in current and sub- directories.

## Pack / Unpack

Pack:

- `Alt+F5` / `Ctrl+Alt+F5`

- To save the archive in the current dir, set `CA+F5=cm_PackFiles` in `[Shortcuts]` session of `wincmd.ini` file. `Ctrl+Alt+F5`

Unpack:

- `Alt+F9`, then clear the input field (empty means current folder)

- check `Unpack each archive ...` to save in a subfolder

::: {.callout-tip}
to make it a default manner (save in a subfolder instead of current folder), set `UnZIPSeperateSubdirs=-2` in `[Packer]` section of `wincmd.ini`.
:::

Browsing packed file:

- browse like a normal folder

- `Ctrl + →` or `Ctrl + ←` or `Ctrl + PageDown`: open in right/left/current panel

## rename

`Shift+F6` is the default (change filename), press again to include extension

use `F2` is recommended.

add `F2=cm_RenameOnly` in `[Shortcuts]` section
