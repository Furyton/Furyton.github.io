openACC

GPU not sharable

openacc.org

openacc best programming

---

three levels

data

## optimize

Unified virtual memory, auto, slow

remove the "managed" suboption to the -ta compiler

data clauses

allocate with copy

- copyin {list}: cpu $\to$ gpu

- copyout {list}: gpu $\to$ cpu

- copy {list}

allocate without copy

- create {list}

- delete {list}

only copy

- present {list}: only copy if present when copyin

pragma

```c++
#pragam acc data copyin (a[0:nelem]) copyout(b[s/4:3*s/4])
```

run functions in each devices, and do copyin, copyout in the functions

slow

we can copyin and copyout together

---

`data`

```c++

#pragma acc data
{
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    ...
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    ...
}
```

copyin and copyout in each loops are done in one clause

---

`enter data`: copyin, create

`exit data`: copyout, delete, finalize(destroy a variable not regarding its reference)

```c++
class M{
    M() {
        v = new double[N];
        #pragma acc enter data create(v)
    }
    ~M() {
        #pragma acc exit data delete(v)
        {
            free(v);
        }
    }
}

```

---

running with explicit data management

data racing
update between cpu and gpu

```c++
do_somthing_on_device();

#pragma acc update host(a)

do_something_on_host();

#pragma acc update device(a)
```

---

reduce IO between cpu and GPU

## optimize loops

optimize matvec loops

default iteration is 128 for GPU

three level

Gang, workers, vectors

one SMP $\to$ 64 cores, 16 warps(1 warp = 32 threads), at most 2048 threads

- set vector size as 32 k

worker = warp
<!-- vector = thread -->

```c++
#pragma acc parallel vector_length(32)
#pragma acc loop gang worker
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    #pragma acc loop vector // vector loop
    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
```

vector loop: has to specify `vector_length` or `num_workers`

collapse clause

```c++
#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)
for (i)
    for (j)
```

equiv

```c++
#pragma acc parallel loop
for (ij)
```

---

the tile clause

operate on smaller blocks of the operation to exploit data locality

---

stride-1 memory access

continus access

`a[0][i][j]`
