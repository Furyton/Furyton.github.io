review

1. fundamental

- DAG

- work-span analysis
  
  - ideal: $T_1(n)=T_s(n)$, $T_\infty(n)=\Theta(\log^k(n))$

- only consider shared data memory model

algorithm：

- map: n->n

associative

- reduce:n -> 1

- scan: n -> n

  - compact: n -> m

- list ranking: n -> n, input becomes linked list, **GRAPH, BFS, DFS**, find independent

- sorting, sample sort

goal:

- optimal complexity

- independent ++, sync --, don't use sync too much, has cost, e.g. print message during parallel

- e.g. histgram, lock in each bucket

- symetrics --, repeat occurance, break symetric, **use randomize**

thinking:

- case to general

- forward - backward, cover gap between input and output

- bit-wise, radix sort

- **matrix-wise**, compute fibonacci sequence, matrix operation

pattern

- divide & conquer

- indep set

- random

- jump

- Eulur tour

- Bag of pennants (conform divide and conquer patterm)

openacc

profile driven programming

- analyse

- parallel

- optimize

**incremental** programming

CPU -> GPU -> Unified memory -> data parallel -> loop -> blocking

blocking:

- IO and compute parallel

- multi-device

---

Analyse

- observe profile

- bottle-neck, for loop

- improve $\frac{\text{compute}}{\text{mem}}$ access ratio

Parallel

- algorithm

Optimize

- data movement, manual management

- large matrix, sometimes we don't need load all the elements

- loop mapping: tell compile how loop maps the level of parallel, e.g. vetor length

- vector 32*n -> n warps

- blocking, 流水线并行

  - input compute output

  - compute -> futher split -> multi device

- tile <- GPU 2-level cache usage

- collapse

- memory access pattern, keep continuous access
