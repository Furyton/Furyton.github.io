recursion

scan

map, reduce, scan

## compact alg

pick up using an indication arr

A = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
F = 0 1 1 0 0 1 0

output = 1 2 5

key to do parallel, acknowledge the **target position** in advance

scan F

idx = 0 1 2 2 2 3 3

## fragment sum

### application

---

F zero flag put in the front, one flag in the back

two stage compact, $F^{-1}$ first, then use $F$

---

scatter

![what is scatter](/images/scatter.svg)

make it into a large sparse matrix and then reduce sum

---

binary base sort

**Radix sort**.

```t
for from lowbit to highbit

scan
```

$T_1(n,b)=O(bn)$

$T_\infty(n,b)=(blogn)$

if from highbit to lowbit, need fragment scan

**bit-wise thinking**.
