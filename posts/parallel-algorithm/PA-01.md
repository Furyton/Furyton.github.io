`gcc -fopenmp`

`omp_num_thread(int)`: request

multi-data

omp_get_thread_num, get id

---

SMP: equal-time access cost, in theory

NUMA: different .., practically

---

False Sharing

cache line

two processors may have access to the same region, repeat many useless write back

---

Synchronization, to avoid data racing, false sharing (avoid global array)
d
barrier

```c
#pragma omp barrier
```

critical

only one thread can enter (often cost cheap), mutual exclusion, avoid data racing

(software support)

```c
#pragma omp critical
```

atomic

only support (hardware support)

- x binopr= expr

- x++, ++x, x--, --x

```c
#pragma omp atomic
```
