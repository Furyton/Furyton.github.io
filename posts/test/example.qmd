## cite at the margin

Colorbars indicate the quantitative extent of image data.
Placing in a figure is non-trivial because room needs to
be made for them.
The simplest case is just attaching a 
colorbar to each axes:^[See the [Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/colorbar_placement.html) to explore colorbars further].
